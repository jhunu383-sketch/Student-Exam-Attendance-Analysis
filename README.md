# 📊 School Exam Attendance Analysis  
**Minor 1 Project – Pandas**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **school exam attendance data** using **Python and Pandas**.  
The objective is to identify **attendance and absentee patterns** across different subjects and exam days.  
The analysis is enhanced with **data visualizations** and an **interactive Gradio-based UI**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze exam-wise attendance records
- Identify absentee patterns across subjects
- Compare present vs absent students
- Visualize attendance trends using charts and heatmaps
- Generate a summary report for academic insights

## 🗂 Dataset Description
- **Total Students:** 50  
- **Total Subjects:** 5  
- **Total Exam Days:** 5  
- **Exam Type:** Final  
- **Each day:** One subject exam conducted for the same 50 students  

### Subjects Included:
- Science  
- Mathematics  
- English  
- Social Studies  
- Computer Science  

### Key Columns:
- Student_ID  
- Student_Name  
- Subject  
- Exam_Type  
- Exam_Date  
- Attendance_Status (Present / Absent)  
- Reason_for_Absence

## 🎨 Interactive Dashboard (Gradio UI)
An interactive **Gradio-based dashboard** is created where users can:
- Upload the attendance CSV file
- View subject-wise attendance graphs
- Analyze day-wise trends
- Visualize absentee heatmaps
- Generate an automated summary report

---

## 📝 Summary Report
The project automatically generates a textual summary including:
- Total students, subjects, and exam days
- Overall attendance distribution
- Observations on absentee patterns
- Insights related to exam stress and subject difficulty

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Upload the dataset CSV file
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step
4. Launch the Gradio interface
5. Explore interactive visualizations
