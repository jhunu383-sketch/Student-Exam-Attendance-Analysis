# School-Exam-Attendance-Analysis:

## Overview :
This project analyzes school exam attendance data using Python to identify attendance patterns and absentee trends across multiple subjects and exam days.
The project was developed using Google Colab as part of a Minor Academic Project and is maintained on GitHub for documentation and version control.

### Objectives:
Analyze student attendance across multiple exam days
Compare present and absent counts
Perform subject-wise absentee analysis
Visualize attendance data using charts and heatmaps
Generate a concise summary report

#### Dataset Information:
Number of Students: 50
Number of Subjects: 5
Exam Duration: 5 Days
File Format: CSV

##### Fields Included:
Student ID
Subject
Exam Date
Attendance Status (Present / Absent)

###### Tools & Technologies
Python
Google Colab
Pandas – Data analysis and manipulation
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Seaborn – Heatmaps and advanced charts
NumPy – Numerical computations

####### Features:
Attendance count analysis
Subject-wise absentee percentage
Graphical representation of attendance data
Heatmap visualization for absentee patterns
Automatically generated summary report

######## Visual Analysis:

The project includes:
Bar charts for attendance comparison
Pie charts for overall attendance distribution
Heatmaps to highlight subjects with higher absentee rates
These visualizations improve data interpretation and insight generation.

Key Observations:
Absenteeism varies across subjects
Certain subjects show relatively higher absentee percentages
Heatmaps provide a clear overview of attendance trends
